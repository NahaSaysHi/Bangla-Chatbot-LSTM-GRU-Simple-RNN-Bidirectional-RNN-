I created a chatbot using an existing Bangla json dataset from Kaggle. The Chatbot uses neural networks to understand user input in Bangla and responds contextually. The chatbot was created separately using LSTM, GRU, Simple RNN and Bidirectional RNN. Various evaluation metrics were shown for each neural network. For instance, precision, recall, f1 score and accuracy. Confusion matrix and sample question with there corresponding answers were also shown. Please run each file on Colab, Please make sure to import the dataset. Link to dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abijitbarua/bangla-healthcare-chatbot-json-data
